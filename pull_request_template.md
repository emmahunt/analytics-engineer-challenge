## PR summary
- [ ] Documentation edited/added (dbt docs)
- [ ] Checked that SQL follows style guide by running the SQLFluff linter `sqlfluff lint models/`
- [ ] Macros used where appropriate for code abstraction

## Testing
- [ ] Every model should be tested AND documented in a `schema.yml` file. At minimum, unique, not nullable fields, and foreign key constraints should be tested, if applicable ([Docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/testing-and-documentation))
- [ ] The output of dbt test should be pasted directly below this point
