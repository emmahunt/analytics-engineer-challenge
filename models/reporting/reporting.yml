models:
  - name: user_retention
    description: "This model supports visualisation of retention analysis, by providing the cohort weekly activity data in a format that enables calculating the retention rate at any level of filtering by user dimensional attributes. The retention rate can be calculated by summing the active users and dividing by the cohort size: the data is structured with cohort sizes on different rows to the active user values, which means the columns can be safely aggregated over without the denominator in the retention calculation being 'double counted'. This data set supports whole dataset retention analysis and also segmented analysis."
