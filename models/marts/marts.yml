This is a hashed surrogate key over a combination of the path, user_identifier and received_at columns. It seems that there are some cases where the same user can access 2 different pages at the exact same time, so the path is required as part of this unique key."

        description: "The foreign key to the dim_user dimension. This column can be used to join the pageview fact table to the user dimension table to derive additional descriptive attributes about the user.
