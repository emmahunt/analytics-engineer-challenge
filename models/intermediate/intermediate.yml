  - name: int_page_views_joined_to_user
    description: "This intermediate model performs some logic to join the page view table to the users table. This is required because the user id in the page view table does not join directly to the users table, so the link between the pageview user identifier and the user table user_id must be inferred by the timestamp of a corresponding page view in the page views table.\n 
    
    There are a few page views that used as a proxy event for a user being created: any that are categorised in the dim_web_page dimension as being associated with account creation. This is based on an assumption that there are many different landing pages that will trigger a user account being created in the 'backend' user system. When using just a single account page (e.g. '/first-time-visit') as a proxy event for a user account being created, the match rate between page views and users was too low to be useful. So, many different page views are assessed and a match is attempted to the user system based on the timestamp of these events."
    columns:
      - name: user_identifier
        description: "The unique identifier for a user as found in the page views table. This identifier is a 36-character string of alphanumeric characters of UUID / GUID format."
        tests:
          - unique
          - not_null
      - name: user_id
        description: "The user_id from the users table that corresponds to the user_identifier from the page view data set, according to a best attempt at matching based on the timestamp of a page view associated with account creation, and the created_at data in the users table. It is not a certain match, but rather a best guess."
        tests:
          - unique
  - name: int_weekly_active_users
    description: "This model partitions user activity into weekly periods since the user was created, and flags if the user was active in that period. It is a helper model that will be used to generate user retetion models"

    columns:
      - name: user_cohort_week
        description: "The starting date of the week in which the user was created (the created_at date): column taken from the user dimension. This will be used as a cohort group in a retention model, so that the activity of users of different creation times can be directly compared."
      - name: user_id
        description: "Unique identifier for a user."
      - name: segment
        description: "The segment of the user, taken from in the user dimension. Can be either 'PERSONAL' or 'ENTERPRISE'. This column is a dimension / drill down filter of the retention model."
      - name: weeks_since_first_active
        description: "The number of weeks since the user was created (the created_at date) in which there was pageview activity by the user. This is calculated by subtracting the page view received_at date from the user created_at date, and then dividing by 7 to get the number of weeks. This column is used as to form the definition of a user 'still being active' in that week."
      - name: active_during_period
        description: "A flag column which is set to 1 if the user was active during the week. As this model is formed by grouping up a users' page views, there will be no row for any weeks in which the user was not active, so this column will only have a value of 1."
      - name: cohort_size
        description: "This column is a placeholder for unioning and is hard coded to null. It is kept null in this model to ensure that the final retention model can be aggregated at any level and the columns remain additive."

      - name: cohort_size
        description: "The count of users in the particular cohort group and segment. Only users that have a non-null user_identifier (e.g. have been joined to the page view dataset) are included in this cohort count for consistency in the data set used in retention analysis."
